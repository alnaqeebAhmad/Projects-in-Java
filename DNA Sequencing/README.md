### Program that checks if a protein is in a strand of DNA

## DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as:-

- A: Adenine
- C: Cytosine
- G: Guanine
- T: Thymine
- So a strand of DNA could look something like ACGAATTCCG.

# A protein has the following qualities:

- It begins with a “start codon”: ATG.
- It ends with a “stop codon”: TGA.
- In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.
